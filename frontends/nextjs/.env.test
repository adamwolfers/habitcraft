# Next.js Frontend Test Environment Variables
# Used for unit tests (Jest) - API calls are mocked so URL doesn't matter
# For E2E tests (Playwright), see playwright.config.ts

# API Base URL (same as dev - unit tests mock fetch anyway)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Test Credentials (documented for convenience)
# Test User 1: test@example.com / Test1234!
# Test User 2: test2@example.com / Test1234!
